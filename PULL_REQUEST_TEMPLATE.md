#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Alicia Lycan and Ayanle paired together. It took about 5 hours.

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on forking the project and copying the starter-code file.

  3. Then we implemented the jQuery ajax calls to retrieve and store data.
  4. Lastly, we displayed the data on live-server.
