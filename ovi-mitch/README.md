# AJAX and JSON and WRRC

**Author**: Ovi Parasca / Mitch Hall
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This lab used AJAX to pull in data from a local JSON file (simulating pulling data from a server) and used that data to render a blog of articles to an HTML page. That data was also pushed to local storage so the next time the page is loaded the articles are loaded from local storage rather than having AJAX pull the data from the JSON file. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Javascript then utilizes the following libraries JQuery and Handlebars. Javascript is also utilizing AJAX and JSON to grab data from a local file simulating a remote server. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:
1405 Ovi forks repository
1406 Ovi adds Mitch as colaborator.
1407 Ovi creates branch Ovi-Mitch and initializes files.
1408 Ovi searches documents for TODO's / COMMENTS / REVIEWS
1409 Ovi and Mitch verbally "whiteboard" what needs to be done to complete the lab
1410 Ovi as driver Mitch as navigator begins to work on article.js. The work flowed from here adding code, testing code and such. Timestamps were not recorded for work performed, the flow just continued from one line to the next. No natural break-point was found during codeing to switch driver-navigator.
1449 Re-arranged order of scripts in index.html
1450 Confirmed page loads as expected initially pulling in articles from local JSON file, and then loaded from local memory.
1553 Ovi commits changes
