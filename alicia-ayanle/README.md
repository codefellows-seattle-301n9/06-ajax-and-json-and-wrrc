# AJAX and JSON and WRRC

**Authors**: Alicia Lycan and Ayanle
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
We are building an application that displays locally stored data. We are building it as a proof of concept to work with locally stored data and display in live-server.

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository and create a copy of the starter-code file. 
2. Navigate into folder called Alicia-Ayanle.
3. Run live-server to display application.

## Architecture
We used the jQuery library to make calls, locally store files, and locally store data in the browser.

## Change Log
12-14-2017 8:00pm - We used jQuery to get and store data from local folder and persist it in the browser's local storage service.

12-16-2017 10:00am - Implement call to display data on live server regardless of the state of the local storage.

## Credits and Collaborations
The application was pair-programmed by Alicia Lycan and Ayanle.
