# Project Name
Local Storage Blog Articles

**Author**: Cody Green & Devin Cunningham
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We are adding the ability to load articles from an external source so that the end user does not need to keep all of the articles on their local machine.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Download the github repo and edit the code in your text editor. Then run on live-server.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used JS, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Handlebars, AJAX, JSON.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
-->
No changes have been made since the original assignment has been turned in.

## Credits and Collaborations
