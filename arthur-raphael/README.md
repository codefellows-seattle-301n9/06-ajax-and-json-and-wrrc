Early in the week I followed the lecture and made some changes to the starter code.  On Thursday, Raphael and I paired together to make some changes to the code.  On Saturday we finally turned on Live Server and tackled the code seriously.  We fixed some bugs and finished the task.

I keep forgetting to start README from the start, or committing changes often enough.
