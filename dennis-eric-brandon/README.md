## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This app uses a local JSON file as an emulation of a remote data source that provides JSON. It loads my articles from an external source and saves it to local storage. 
## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
  1. First, I started on cloning down the repo to my local machine.
  2. Next, we went through the TODO's and comments setting up a plan of what we wanted to work on first.
  3. Next, we worked on completing the TODO's and comments.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used a CDN for our jQuery library and linked it in at the bottom of our HTML. Also used a normailze.css file linked into our HTML at the top of our CSS links so that we start with a consistent browser rendering. We also used Handlebars.js to help with settign up a template for the articles. Additionally we addded in a script for ajax.
